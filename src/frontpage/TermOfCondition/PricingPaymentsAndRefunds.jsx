            <p>
              1. Pricing and Payments: You can purchase a Subscription Service
              of your choice for any category(ies) of content by following
              instructions on the Platform and making the payment applicable for
              the Subscription you intend to purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please read the below terms applicable for the purchase of your
              Platform Subscription. The below terms are to be read with any
              other terms communicated to you at the time of purchase of your
              Subscription:
            </p>
          </div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              a. You agree to pay all Subscription fees and charges that are
              attributable to your account on the Platform and that you are
              solely responsible for payment of these fees and charges. The
              Subscriptions are payable in full and in advance and are valid
              until the completion of the applicable Subscription Period or
              until otherwise cancelled or terminated in accordance with the
              terms of this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              b. If you have specifically authorized us, then the payments for
              the applicable Subscriptions are automatically charged at the
              beginning of each billing period, unless you withdraw your
              authorization or submit a cancellation request to us directly
              through your account prior to the start of the billing period or
              in writing via email to the address specified in the ‘Contact for
              User Support/Queries’ section below. The payment for your
              Subscription will be charged upon the anniversary of its billing
              period if the payments for Subscription are in more than a single
              tranche. Subject to your specific authorization and applicable
              laws, you agree that EduMetrix may charge any recurring service to
              the credit card or debit card or account that you provide/link at
              the time of your first purchase of the Subscription or as updated
              by you through your account on the Platform, provided such
              updation takes place prior to upcoming billing period.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  c. If you have not completed payments for your Subscriptions,
                  we may restrict / suspend your access to the Platform until
                  your account becomes current and paid in full.
                </li>
                <li>
                  d. We reserve the right to pursue the fee owed to us using
                  collection methods which may include charging other payment
                  methods on file with us and/or retaining collection agencies
                  or legal counsel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  e. Your payments to EduMetrix shall be subject to applicable
                  taxes including without limitation Goods and Service Taxes
                  (GST) and Value Added Taxes (VAT) or other similar taxes as
                  may be applicable in your country of residence/from where you
                  have created your account on the Platform/ purchased the
                  underlying Subscriptions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  f. We reserve the right to change/revise the pricing of the
                  Subscriptions. For existing Subscriptions for which the
                  applicable fees have been already received by us, we will
                  implement the price changes during the next billing period or
                  renewal of the Subscription.
                </li>
                <li>
                  g. We further reserve the right to offer custom plans and
                  pricing (including discounts and / or special offers) in
                  addition to what is offered on the Platform, which include
                  offering custom billing and payment terms, that are different
                  from our standard terms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  h. We use third-party payment gateways and/or aggregators to
                  process payments applicable to the Services offered by us.
                  Third-party payment gateway(s) made available to you may vary
                  depending on the Subscription you choose. Similarly, we have
                  also enabled integration of third-party payment providers to
                  facilitate better payment options to you, which may vary
                  depending on your territory or the Subscription you choose.
                  Third-party payment gateways/aggregators and thirdparty
                  payment providers shall collectively be referred to as
                  “Third-Party Service Providers”.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Third-Party Service Providers may also charge you fees to use
                  or access their services and may require your Personal
                  Information to complete any transaction for the Platform.
                  Further, to facilitate completion of your payments to us
                  through the Platform or avail the payment options provided to
                  you, you may be redirected to an external website operated by
                  the Third-Party Service Provider. We cannot and do not (i)
                  guarantee the adequacy of the privacy and security practices
                  employed by or the content and media provided by the
                  Third-Party Service Provider or its respective website s or

                  such Third-Party Service Provider. Hence, prior to using any
                  services offered by a Third-Party Service Provider, we suggest
                  that you read their terms and conditions, privacy policy and
                  other policies, that may apply, to understand their terms of
                  usage and to understand how your Personal information is being

                  may be required to enter into a separate agreement with the
                  relevant Third-Party Service Provider. This agreement with the
                  Third-Party Service Provider is an independent
                  contract/agreement between you and such Third-Party Service
                  Provider and EduMetrix shall in no manner be a party to the
                  same. EduMetrix is only facilitating various payment options
                  to you and is not offering the payment by itself in any
                  manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                  i. You agree that you are solely responsible for all charges
                  that occur through such Third-Party Service Providers and

                  respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from any
                  loss arising out of or related to the use of the Platform or
                  any purchases made through the Platform. This obligation will
                  survive your use of the Platform and termination of your
                  Agreement with us. For purposes of the Platform Terms, “Loss”
                  means all losses, liabilities, damages, awards, settlements,
                  claims, suits, proceedings, costs, and expenses (including
                  reasonable legal fees and disbursements and costs of
                  investigation, litigation, settlement, judgment, interest, and
                  penalties). EduMetrix shall not be liable to you for any
                  claims arising out of any act or omission on the part of the
                  Third-Party Service Provider(s) including, but not limited to,
                  any lost, stolen, or incorrectly processed payments. EduMetrix

                  parties (except Third-Party Service Provider(s)). We do not
                  usually authorize any third party (except ThirdParty Service
                  Provider(s)) to collect monies on our behalf; however, if we
                  have authorized any third party then such third party will
                  have received a written authorization from EduMetrix either by
                  way of any agreement or an authorization letter. Kindly verify
                  with such third party before you make any payments to them,
                  alternatively, you can always check with us by writing to us
                  at email address provided under the ‘Contact for User
                  Support/Queries’ section below.
